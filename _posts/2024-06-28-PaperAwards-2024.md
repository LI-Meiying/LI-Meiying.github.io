My publication, "Devaluation for Whom? Feminization and Wages in An Economically Polarized Labor Market, 2003â€“2019," has received two paper awards from the American Sociological Association (ASA): 
- Robert D. Mare Graduate Student Paper Award (2024), ASA Section on Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility (IPM)
- Honorable Mention for the Burt Best Student Paper Award (2024), ASA Section on Economic Sociology

I want to express my deepest gratitude to my advisor, Jen Hook, who has guided me through  step of this research and edited this paper countless times. I also want to thank Emily Smith-Greenaway and Dan Schrage for their invaluable comments and feedback! Moreover, although the R&R process was intimidating, this paper has truly benefited from the reviewers' insights. Their comments helped me expand the scope of my reading and gain more confidence in my arguments and analyses. 
Finally, I want to encourage my fellow Ph.D. students to nominate their papers! I was motivated to do so by my colleague and dear friend, Blanca Ramirez. Without her encouragement, I would have never thought to submit my work or believed I could achieve so much. This has been a truly magical process.
