I passed my dissertation defense today! I am deeply grateful to my advisor, Jennifer Hook. I owe my academic achievements to her. I would also like to express my deep appreciation to my committee members: Dan Schrage, Tim Biblarz, Emily Smith-Greenaway, and Julie Zissimopoulos. Their guidance made my journey possible. I am also immensely grateful for the support and assistance I have received from our sociology department at USC, my colleagues, friends, and family members. Thank you all for being my pillars of strength!
