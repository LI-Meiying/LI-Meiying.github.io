I’m currently transitioning from academic research to applied roles in user experience (UX), people analytics, and socially aware data science. My work has always focused on real-world outcomes—how people make decisions in complex systems shaped by work, policy, culture, social and economic structure. I'm now eager to bring that systems-level thinking, analytical rigor, and user-centered perspective to industry.

### Key strengths:
- Modeled user pathways across work, family, and health using longitudinal and survey data
- Designed cross-national datasets to ensure policy and income comparability across diverse environments
- Applied causal inference, machine learning (LASSO, XGBoost), and sequence analysis to uncover behavioral patterns
- Translated insights into narratives that inform equity-driven policy and system design

### Industry interests:
I'm especially interested in roles that value:
- Behavioral research at scale  
- Inclusive product and system design  
- People-centered decision support  
- Translating complex data into actionable insights for users, teams, and organizations

I’m open to opportunities in **UX research**, **applied data science**, **people analytics**, and **research strategy**.
