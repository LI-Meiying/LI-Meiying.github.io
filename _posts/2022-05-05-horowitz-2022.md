  I feel excited to share the news that My dissertation "Is the Gender Wage Gap Mitigated or Exacerbated by Family Policies? Evidence from a Cross-National Analysis of OECD Countries" has been selected by the Trustees of the <a href="https://www.horowitz-foundation.org/2021#:~:text=Meiying%20Li,L.%20Stanley%20Award">Horowitz Foundation for Social Policy</a> to receive the 2021 grant ($7,500). This project also receives the John L. Stanley Award for History and Ethics ($1,500).
