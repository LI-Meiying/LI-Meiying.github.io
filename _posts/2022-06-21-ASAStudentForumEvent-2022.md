  International students in sociology are disadvantaged in the labor market because we only have one year OPT (Optional Practical Training) to secure jobs that offer long-term work visa. My dear colleagues and I at USC Sociology have been advocating to STEM sociology and extend the OPT from 1 year to 3 years. We have received much support from many faculty members in our department and ASA. This time, we will organize a workshop with the ASA Student Forum, share our thoughts and efforts on the issue with students across the U.S. and those who are also interested in addressing the issue.
