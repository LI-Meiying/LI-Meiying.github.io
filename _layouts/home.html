  I am a postdoctoral researcher in the <a href="https://publicpolicy.cornell.edu/">Jeb E. Brooks School of Public Policy at Cornell University</a>. 
 My research centers on how macro-level conditions, such as occupational sex segregation in the U.S., marketization in China, and family policies in OECD countries, affect individual-level labor market outcomes. 
  
  My dissertation examines the linkage between occupational sex segregation and gender wage inequality in the economically polarized, post-2000 labor market. In another publication, I study how marketization has affected gender wage inequality in China. I have also co-authored several publications exploring how work-family reconciliation policies have affected on gender inequality for women by social class, and how neighborhood inequality has perpetuated unequal access to COVID vaccination.
